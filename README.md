# Linear-Regression-Bike-Sharing-Assignment

We need to build a multi linear regression model to predict the demand for shared bikes.

Problem Statement

A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.

Objective

The obective of this case study was to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It would be used by the management of 'Boom Bikes' to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They would accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and customer's expectations.
